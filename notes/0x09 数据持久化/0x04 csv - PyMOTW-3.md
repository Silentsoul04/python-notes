**Purpose: **读写 CSV (Comma Separated Value) 文件



The `csv` module can be used to work with data exported from spreadsheets and databases into text files formatted with fields and records, commonly referred to as *comma-separated value* (CSV) format because commas are often used to separate the fields in a record.
