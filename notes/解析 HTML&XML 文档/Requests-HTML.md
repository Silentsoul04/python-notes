## 概述

> This library intends to make parsing HTML (e.g. scraping the web) as simple and intuitive as possible.
>
> When using this library you automatically get:
>
> - **Full JavaScript support**!
> - *CSS Selectors* (a.k.a jQuery-style, thanks to PyQuery).
> - *XPath Selectors*, for the faint at heart.
> - Mocked user-agent (like a real web browser).
> - Automatic following of redirects.
> - Connection–pooling and cookie persistence.
> - The Requests experience you know and love, with magical parsing abilities.
